x86

(32-bit a.k.a. i386–i686 and 64-bit a.k.a. amd64. In other words, your workstation, laptop or server.)
FAQ: Do I have…

    64-bit (x86_64/AMD64/Intel64)? lm
    Hardware virtualization (VMX/AMD-V)? vmx (Intel), svm (AMD)
    Accelerated AES (AES-NI)? aes
    TXT (TPM)? smx
    a hypervisor (announced as such)? hypervisor

Most of the other features are only of interest to compiler or kernel authors.
All the flags

The full listing is in the kernel source, in the file arch/x86/include/asm/cpufeatures.h.

P.S. This listing was derived from arch/x86/include/asm/cpufeature.h in the kernel source. The flags are listed in the same order as the source code. Please help by adding links to descriptions of features when they're missing, by writing a short description of features that have an unexpressive names, and by updating the list for new kernel versions. The current list is from Linux 4.15-rc7.

    Thanks @Gilles and editors for an informative question & its summarized and detailed answer. Now, to check whatever CPU capabilities, I use the following taken from NixCraft, eg for Intel CPUs: $ egrep -wo ^flags|vmx|ept|vpid|npt|tpr_shadow|flexpriority|vnmi|lm|aes' /proc/cpuinfo --color | sort -u. And there's also the CLI/GUI excellent i-nex. – tuk0z Sep 22 '15 at 14:55
    Outstanding collection of explanations & links; thanks to everyone who contributed. – Paul Gear Mar 8 '17 at 4:11

ARM

On ARM processors, a few features are mentioned in the features: line. Only features directly related to the ARM architecture are mentioned there, not features specific to a silicon manufacturer or system-on-chip.

The features are obtained from looking up the CPU id with read_cpuid() and looking it up in the processor type definitions known at compile time where the features are expressed as a mask of HWCAP_xxx flags. The corresponding strings are in hwcap_str etc. in setup.c.

In the list below, ARMv6 introduced SIMD instructions and datatypes. ARMv7 provided Advanced SIMD instructions and datatypes. On 32-bit ARM machines, neon signals Advanced SIMD; while asimd signals Advanced SIMD on 64-bit arm machines.

    swp: SWP instruction (atomic read-modify-write)
    half: Half-word loads and stores
    thumb: Thumb (16-bit instruction set)
    26bit: "26 Bit" Model (Processor status register folded into program counter)
    fastmult: 32×32→64-bit multiplication
    fpa: Floating point accelerator
    vfp: VFP (early SIMD vector floating point instructions)
    edsp: DSP extensions (the 'e' variant of the ARM9 CPUs, and all others above)
    java: Jazelle (Java bytecode accelerator)
    iwmmxt: SIMD instructions similar to Intel MMX
    crunch: MaverickCrunch coprocessor (if kernel support enabled)
    thumbee: ThumbEE
    neon: Advanced SIMD/NEON (asimd on AArch64 older kernels)
    vfpv3: VFP version 3
    vfpv3d16: VFP version 3 with 16 D-registers
    tls: TLS register
    vfpv4: VFP version 4 with fast context switching
    idiva: SDIV and UDIV hardware division in ARM mode
    idivt: SDIV and UDIV hardware division in Thumb mode
    vfpd32: VFP with 32 D-registers
    lpae: Large Physical Address Extension (>4GB physical memory on 32-bit architecture)
    evtstrm: kernel event stream using generic architected timer
    aes: hardware-accelerated AES (secret-key cryptography)
    pmull{2}: 64×64→128-bit F2m multiplication — acceleration for the GCM mode of authenticated encryption
    sha1: hardware-accelerated SHA-1
    sha2: hardware-accelerated SHA-256
    crc32: hardware-accelerated CRC-32

Beyond that, the Hardware: line indicates the processor model. Depending on the model, there may be other information in other files under /proc or /sys, or in boot-time kernel log messages. Unfortunately each ARM CPU manufacturer has its own method for reporting processor features, if any.
