</ul>

<p>Please note that inxi will always support all Linux distributions as long as they have Perl 5.xx and the other recommended applications, and inxi dependencies will never require the latest of anything, so you can always safely install inxi on a system then update it to latest inxi version no matter what. In other words, if inxi runs the first time you install it, after updating dependencies, inxi will always run on your system, as long as the project remains in these hands. </p>
<p>If you use your distribution's package management system to install inxi, then you will have the man pages, if you install it manually, then just run inxi -U one time and it will grab the man page as well during the update. </p>
<p>Because inxi is spreading widely through the distribution ecosystem, always first check to see if a primary or secondary repository for your distribution has inxi before installing it manually, though some distributions have seriously out of data inxi versions, so you might want to install the package, then update it manually with -U. See the <a href="/docs/inxi-faqs.htm">inxiFAQs</a> page for directions on how to override distribution blocks of -U. </p>

<p>See <a href="#using-inxi-in-konversation">bottom of page</a> for directions on setting up Konversation links so you can just type in /inxi options to show inxi in IRC. </p>

<h2 id="inxi-repo-install">Installing inxi from distro repos</h2>

<p>I can't track all the Linux distributions, these are the ones I know about as of 2022-06-01:</p>

<ul>
<li>Note that due to a long term unfortunate default in Debian and maybe Ubuntu, in certain situations failure to use the <pre>--no-install-recommends</pre> flags can lead to a huge daisy chained series of extra packages, not one of which inxi uses or needs.</li>
<li>As of Debian Jesse, Debian Sid/Testing - inxi is in apt, so just do:  </li>
<pre>apt-get install --no-install-recommends inxi </pre>
If in doubt, just search for it in apt, it's there, install it. 
<pre>apt-cache search inxi </pre></li>
<li>A few other Debian based distributions have intermittently also packaged inxi, like AntiX, Mint.</li>
<li>Ubuntu users, check if it's in your basic repositories with this command: 
<pre>apt-cache search inxi </pre>
If it is, just install it with apt. If it is not, add the unit193 repository like so: 
<pre>
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:unit193/inxi &amp;&amp; apt-get update
## then just install inxi, 
apt-get install --no-install-recommends inxi</pre>
</li>
<li>Arch Linux: inxi is in either in the Community Repos or in AUR (it varies year to year, check AUR first), so just install inxi as you normally would any other package. It's usually reasonably current.</li>
<li>Fedora has inxi, and it's also in EPEL, I believe RHEL has inxi, but you can always install it via EPEL in Redhat/Centos etc. Very slow, to never, updating to new versions in past release pools of Fedora, CentOS, or RHEL. Their updates vary, but they are usually within a release or two on average in their current pools and rawhide. They do not update older releases.</li>
<li>Funtoo: Usually up to date, but check..</li>
<li>Gentoo: support varies, check. Not as 'rolling release' as you'd expect.</li>
<li>Mageia: They have been pretty good about keeping their version up to date over the years, but that has dropped off so probably better off updating it yourself, or just not using the packaged version..</li>
<li>Mandriva also have inxi in their repositories, but check to see if it's a current or reasonably new version. If not, I recommend just installing/updating it manually.</li>
<li>Manjaro: They use inxi for their forum support and package it themselves, so they tend to be very good about shipping the latest inxi in all their branches.</li>
<li>OpenSuSE: updates only intermittently, you're probably better off using the live version..</li>
<li>PCLinuxOS: Varies, from quite current, to significantly out of date. Probably best to update manually.</li>
<li>Slackware: part of core after being in various other repos for some years, they are good about keeping it up to date. </li>
<li>Ubuntu: while the current pool is active, inxi is usually up to date, but once it's EOL or frozen like LTS releases, inxi versions get very old. Better off updating inxi with -U after changing the /etc/inxi.conf to allow updates. Or just install manually.</li>
<li>For Debian Wheezy or older systems, I rocommend using the direct download install via wget, but if you must use apt to install it, use the Unit193 repository (Unit193 is the also the maintainer of the Debian inxi package), which is also the most current one available for apt systems usually. Add the following line (first of course check to see if you don't already have inxi available, or that you have an inxi repo, and change the Ubuntu release name to yours): 
<pre>echo 'deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/unit193/inxi/ubuntu trusty main' &gt; /etc/apt/sources.list.d/unit193-inxi.list</pre></li>
<li>For other distros, check your repositories first before manually installing it, many have it available either in the main repositories, or as a third party repository. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>For smxi users, follow the steps <a href="http://smxi.org/site/install.htm#inxi">here</a>.  But generally if you use Debian use the apt version unless you want to make sure you always have the latest inxi, this would be particularly relevant in Stable.</li>
<li>For most others, use (except in Pardus), as root: </li>
<pre>cd /usr/local/bin &amp;&amp; wget -O inxi smxi.org/inxi &amp;&amp; chmod +x inxi</pre></li>
<li>For Pardus manual inxi install, use, as root:
<pre>cd /usr/bin &amp;&amp; wget -O inxi smxi.org/inxi &amp;&amp; chmod +x inxi</pre></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#top">top</a></p>

<h2 id="using-inxi-in-konversation">Using inxi in Konversation</h2>

<p>For usage in Konversation (as root):</p>
<ul>
<li>
KDE3:
<pre>ln -s /usr/local/bin/inxi /usr/share/apps/konversation/scripts/inxi</pre>
</li>
<li>
KDE4:
<pre>ln -s /usr/local/bin/inxi /usr/share/kde4/apps/konversation/scripts/inxi</pre>
</li>
<li>
KDE5:
<pre>ln -s /usr/local/bin/inxi /usr/share/konversation/scripts/inxi</pre>
If the symbolic link does not result in /inxi working, add this link and it should work right away: 
<pre>ln -s /usr/share/konversation /usr/share/apps/</pre>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="inxi-smxi-install">SMXI Installation</h2>

<p>The Debian only <a href="/site/install.htm#inxi">smxi</a> tool installs inxi with all dependencies and recommends.</p>

<p><a href="#top">top</a></p>

<h2 id="inxi-man-page-install">Installing the inxi man page</h2>

<p>If you did not use a distribution installed package to install inxi, then you might want to run inxi again to update the man pages as well, with this command: inxi -U This will then also install the man pages. Please do not use that option in general if you installed inxi from your distribution's repositories, the packagers should have included the man files in the inxi package. If in doubt, first try this command: man inxi </p>
<p>If nothing happens, you don't have the man page, which means you have either an old install, or you installed it manually. In that case, just upgrade it with -U and everything should be updated automatically. If the man page does not automatically update when you run -U, it means you have an older inxi, and need to use -U again, so the new version can then bring in the man page.</p>
