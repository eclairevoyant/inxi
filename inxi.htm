<p>inxi -b output with --usb added (see <a href="/docs/inxi-screenshots.htm">screenshots</a> for more examples):<br>

<p>inxi is developed to work on most GNU/Linux distributions. The program comes pre-installed in <a href="http://solusos.com/">SolusOS</a>, <a href="http://crunchbanglinux.org/">Crunchbang</a>, <a href="http://www.epidemiclinux.org/">Epidemic</a>, <a href="http://www.linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint</a> and <a href="http://antix.mepis.org">AntiX</a>. Arch Linux, Debian, Ubuntu, Gentoo, Slackware, OpenSUSE, Redhat Epel, and many others have inxi packaged in either their primary or secondary repositories.  We hope, as more maintainers and users discover and find inxi a nice tool, it will find its place in more distributions. </p>

<p>Some distributions are very bad about ever updating inxi, so you might be better off running inxi from the git sources instead if that's the case, since new features and bug fixes are released all the time. Hint: if your inxi version is a major release version lower than current inxi (like current is 3.0.12, and your repo version is 2.2.35), you probably want the <a href="https://github.com/smxi/inxi">git version</a>. Current inxi will always run fine on your system, no matter how old it is.</p>

<p>inxi works on <a href="http://konversation.kde.org/">Konversation</a>, <a href="http://xchat.org/">Xchat</a>, <a href="http://irssi.org/">irssi</a>, <a href="http://quassel-irc.org/">Quassel</a>, as well as on most other IRC clients.  Quassel includes (usually an older version of) inxi. </p>

<p>See <a href="/docs/inxi-options.htm">inxi options</a> here for list of options.  Always check inxi -h to get the full list of the latest options (the wiki page may become outdated). </p>

<h2 id="feedback-bug-reports">Feedback and bug reports</h2>
<p>For us to help you the best, please make sure to include all relevant system data and output when you post bug reports. inxi includes built in data collection tools you can run that create either log files or more full system data. See inxi -h debugger options for more information. Usually the more of your system data we can get, the more easily we can fix the failed case, which is our goal. </p>

<p>But please read the information here on the documentation pages first, almost everything you need to know should be available on this site.</p>

<h2 id="inxi-origins">Origins and current status of inxi</h2>
<p>inxi is a full rewrite of locsmif&#x27;s infobash script. h2 is the primary author, with a few contributions from trash80, damentz (of Liquorix fame), and various other contributors. </p>
<p>The original infobash scripting methods were not debuggable, readable, or maintainable, so we forked it. </p>
<p>We started with a set of bug fixes and code readability updates. Then, once the potential became exposed, we added more features.  The rewrites far exceeded the original utility, thus the inxi project began.  </p>
<p>Version 3.0.0 was another full rewrite, this time to Perl 5.xx (5.08 minimum supported version). Once it had become obvious that Perl 6 was its own language, and Perl 5 was healthy and being developed actively, I decided that the headache of dealing with the Gawk/Bash mix was not worth it long term</p>
<p>The replacement language had to check all the following boxes: A: has been around a long time, B: doesn't break its language features all the time, C: supports complex data structures, D: can run on old systems without breaking, E: Fast (Perl 5 is VERY fast), and F: is a native Practical Extraction and Reporting Language. The latter is, conveniently, exactly what Perl 5 is, and what inxi does (extract and report system data). So in early 2018 inxi Perl, v 3.0.0 was released, and inxi 2.3.56 was put into the git inxi-legacy branch as an historical oddity.</p>
